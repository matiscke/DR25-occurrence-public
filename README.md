# DR25-occurrence
Python notebooks that explain the computation of various DR25 occurrence rate products

This repository contains the analysis results behind our paper "A Probabilistic Approach to Kepler Completeness and Reliability for Exoplanet Occurrence Rates".  The results are found in .html files in the directory GKbaseline/htmlArchive.

It also contains the Python notebooks used to perform this analysis, but does not contain the required stellar property files because they are not yet released.

Working Python notebooks with requied data using published stellar catalogs can be found in the repository stevepur/DR25-occurence-tutorial.
